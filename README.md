# TrinitySeal
The official source code of TrinitySeal .NET Licensing System.

I started TrinitySeal back in March 2018 with little knowledge on how to code as a full-stack developer. Web development was completely new to me. I took inspiration from past services such as BetterSeal and SecureSeal.

I have decided to release my work as I pursue interests in other fields.

I hope this respository can be used positively and teach people what I have taught myself.

TrinitySeal will still be run and managed as usual, but I thought this release may be beneficial to people. Use this wisely!
